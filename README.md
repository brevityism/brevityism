## 👋 About Me

I lead teams that build and support systems powering one of the largest probation departments in the country. With a strong background in software development and cloud infrastructure, I’ve modernized platforms ranging from staff scheduling to emergency alert systems -- making tools faster, smarter, and more secure :contentReference[oaicite:1]{index=1}.

I'm deeply committed to public service and believe technology should simplify life for staff and community alike. Whether guiding system rewrites, designing DevOps strategies, or mentoring emerging leaders, I aim to build solutions that truly work.
